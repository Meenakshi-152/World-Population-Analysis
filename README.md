# World-Population-Analysis
This project analyzes global population data (1970-2022) using Python. It provides insights into population growth, density, and distribution across continents and countries. Using interactive visualizations with Plotly and Seaborn, users can explore trends, identify fast-growing regions, and understand key shifts in global population dynamics.
